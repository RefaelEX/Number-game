Number game
==================
my implementation  in java

The game instructions
------------------------

here is a game that you play against a friend or a computer (computer always wins :) ).
You are given a list of numbers. You move first and pick either the first or the last number from the list,
which is then removed from the list.
Your friend/computer moves next and again picks either the first or the last number from the list that remains.
You move alternately in this manner till all the numbers in the list have been picked.
Your score at the end of the game is the sum of numbers that you have picked.


simply import the project into eclipse and run it :)
